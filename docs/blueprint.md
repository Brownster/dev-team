# **App Name**: DevTeamAI

## Core Features:

- AI Dev Team Simulation: Simulate a software development team with roles like Developer, Tester, Planner/Manager, Researcher, and Doc Creator, using LLM-powered agents.
- Project Planning: Employ the Planner/Manager agent to break down user requests into actionable development tasks. The agent will use its tool to decide when it needs to incorporate tasks based on progress reports.
- Code Generation: Use the Developer agent to generate code based on tasks, focusing on frontend components using Next.js.
- Automated Testing: Have the Tester agent create and run basic tests for the generated components. The agent will use its tool to decide when to rerun tests based on development iteration reports.
- Development Process Visualization: Display the iterative development process, showing task assignments, progress, code snippets, and test results in a clear, step-by-step format.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Teal (#008080) to represent technology and innovation.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#D3D3D3) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent: Electric Blue (#7DF9FF) for highlighting active tasks or important information.
- Clean and modern typography for code snippets and task descriptions.
- Use icons to represent different team roles and task statuses.
- Divide the screen into sections for task management, code display, and test results.
- Subtle animations to indicate progress and updates in real-time.
